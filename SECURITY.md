# Security Policy

## Current Security Status

AutoVideo v1 implements comprehensive application-level security measures to protect the system and user data.

### **Application-Level Security** ✅

- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests per 5 minutes per IP address with automatic enforcement
- **API Call Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics for all external API interactions
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require proper authorization tokens
- **Abuse Prevention**: Automatic detection and blocking of suspicious activity patterns
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed performance monitoring and security event logging

### **Network Security** ✅

- **Simplified Configuration**: Default Cloud Run egress for reliable external API access
- **No Complex VPC Setup**: Eliminated unnecessary network complexity that provided minimal security benefit
- **Encrypted Communications**: All API calls use HTTPS/TLS
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking and monitoring
- **Private Container Registry**: Images stored in private Google Container Registry

### **API Security** ✅

- **Enhanced HTTP Client**: Custom httpx configuration with proper timeouts and connection pooling
- **Fail-Fast Validation**: API key validation at startup with detailed error reporting
- **Timeout Management**: Robust handling of connection timeouts and retries
- **Health Monitoring**: Dedicated endpoints for security and connectivity diagnostics
- **Request Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of all external API calls with success/failure metrics

2. Email security concerns to the repository owner
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for investigation and resolution

### **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Investigation**: 1-7 days depending on complexity  
- **Resolution**: As soon as possible, with security patches prioritized
- **Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and verified

## Security Best Practices

### **For Developers**

- Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Follow the principle of least privilege for permissions
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities

### **For Deployment**

- Use Workload Identity Federation instead of service account keys
- Implement proper IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Enable audit logging and monitoring
- Use private container registries
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials

### **For Operations**

- Monitor system health and API connectivity
- Review access logs regularly
- Implement alerting for security events
- Keep all components updated with latest security patches
- Conduct regular security reviews
