echo "1. Log into the Google Cloud Console with rez.archer@gmail.com (project owner)"
echo "2. Open this direct URL (may work better than our previous attempt):"
echo "   https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?project=$PROJECT_ID"
echo "3. Filter for 'aiplatform' and 'gpu'"
echo "4. Look for these specific quotas:"
echo "   - custom_model_training_nvidia_t4_gpus"
echo "   - custom_model_training_nvidia_l4_gpus" 
echo "5. Check the boxes and click 'EDIT QUOTAS'"
echo "6. Set both to 1 for region us-central1"

echo "===== OPTION 2: QUOTA REQUEST EMAIL ====="
echo "If the console still doesn't work, you can directly email Google Cloud Support:"
echo "1. Send an email to: cloud-support@google.com"
echo "2. Subject: Quota Increase Request for Project $PROJECT_ID"
echo "3. Include in the body:"
echo "   - Project ID: $PROJECT_ID"
echo "   - Project Number: $PROJECT_NUMBER" 
echo "   - Quota: aiplatform.googleapis.com/custom_model_training_nvidia_t4_gpus"

echo "   - Current Limit: 0"
echo "   - Requested Limit: 1"
echo "   - Justification: Required for video generation in AutoVideo project"
echo "   - Repeat the same for L4 GPUs"

echo "===== OPTION 3: CLOUD SUPPORT CONSOLE ====="
echo "1. Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/support/cases/create?project=$PROJECT_ID"
echo "2. Choose 'Technical Support' â†’ 'Quota'"
echo "3. Fill in details for both GPU types"
echo ""

echo "===== OPTION 4: WORKAROUND UNTIL QUOTA APPROVAL ====="
echo "As a temporary solution, you could modify the code to use CPU-only mode:"
echo "1. Edit vertex_gpu_service.py to force CPU-only mode"
echo "2. This will be slower but would work while waiting for quota approval"
