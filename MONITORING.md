# AutoVideo Monitoring & Management System

## Overview

A comprehensive local monitoring and management interface for the AutoVideo system, designed to evolve from simple status monitoring to a full-featured management platform. This system provides real-time visibility into video generation processes, Vertex AI job status, system health, and will expand to include job control and automation features.

## Creation Timeline

### Initial Problem (2025-05-29)
- **Issue**: Status endpoint only showed static messages during long video generation waits
- **Need**: Real-time visibility into Vertex AI job status, queue times, and system health
- **Goal**: Create local monitoring tools that won't interfere with production deployments

### Phase 1: Enhanced Status Endpoint ✅
**Implemented**: Enhanced the main application's `/status` endpoint with real-time Vertex AI job details

**Key Features Added**:
- `get_vertex_ai_job_details()` function using gcloud CLI for reliable job status
- Enhanced status response with job state, machine type, GPU info, duration tracking
- Error handling and detailed failure information
- Structured data for future API consumption

**Technical Details**:
- Uses `gcloud ai custom-jobs list` with filtering for reliability
- Parses timestamps and calculates queue/run/total durations
- Extracts machine specs, GPU configurations, and error messages
- Provides both human-readable and structured data formats

### Phase 2: Local Monitoring Interface ✅
**Implemented**: Comprehensive local monitoring tools completely isolated from production

**Architecture**:
```

├── __init__.py         # Package initialization  
├── status_monitor.py   # Core monitoring functionality
├── cli.py             # Command-line interface
├── monitor.py         # Main entry point
└── README.md          # Package documentation

local_monitor.py        # Original simple monitor (compatibility)
avmonitor              # Convenience script for quick access

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced Status Endpoint (`main.py`)
```python
def get_vertex_ai_job_details(job_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Uses gcloud CLI for reliable job status retrieval
    # Parses timestamps and calculates durations
    # Extracts machine specs and GPU configurations
    # Handles errors and provides structured data
```

**Key Features**:
- Reliable job status using gcloud CLI
- Timestamp parsing and duration calculation
- Machine type and GPU configuration extraction
- Error handling and structured output

#### 2. StatusMonitor Class (`monitor/status_monitor.py`)
```python
class StatusMonitor:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str):
        # Initialize monitoring endpoints
        # Set up health check URLs
        
    def get_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Fetch current system status
        
    def get_health_check(self, endpoint: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Check specific health endpoints
        
    def get_summary_data(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Structured data for API consumption
```

**Capabilities**:
- Multi-endpoint health monitoring
- Status aggregation and formatting
- Continuous monitoring with configurable intervals
- JSON output for automation

#### 3. CLI Interface (`monitor/cli.py`)
```bash
# Status commands
python3 monitor/cli.py status                # Single check
python3 monitor/cli.py status -c             # Continuous
python3 monitor/cli.py status --json         # JSON output

# Health commands  
python3 monitor/cli.py health all            # All endpoints
python3 monitor/cli.py health vertex_ai      # Specific check

# Watch mode
python3 monitor/cli.py watch --interval 10   # Custom refresh
```

### Git Isolation Strategy
All monitoring files are excluded from version control:
```gitignore
# Local monitoring and management app (not for deployment)
monitor/
management/
mgmt/
local_monitor*
dashboard*
status_monitor*
avmonitor
```

**Benefits**:
- No interference with production deployments
- Local customization without conflicts
- Clean separation of monitoring from application code
- Safe experimentation and development

## Usage Examples

### Quick Status Check
```bash
./avmonitor                    # Instant status with enhanced job details
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
./avmonitor watch              # Live monitoring every 30s
./avmonitor watch --interval 10 # Every 10 seconds
```

### Health Diagnostics
```bash
./avmonitor health             # All health checks
./avmonitor health vertex_ai   # Vertex AI specific
./avmonitor health --verbose   # Detailed information
```

### Programmatic Access
```bash
./avmonitor status --json | jq '.summary'     # JSON summary
./avmonitor health all --json | jq '.main'    # Health data
```

2. **Configuration**: Health checks identify what needs configuration
3. **Automation**: JSON output enables scripted responses to status changes
4. **Analytics**: Duration tracking builds performance baseline data
5. **Alerting**: Health monitoring provides failure detection hooks

### API Evolution
```python
# Current monitoring API
GET /status                    # Enhanced with job details
GET /health/{endpoint}         # Component health checks

# Future management API (planned)
POST /jobs/{job-id}/cancel     # Job control
POST /jobs/{job-id}/retry      # Job management  
POST /generate                 # Manual triggers
GET /logs                      # Log access
PUT /config                    # Configuration updates
```
