# Security Policy

## Current Security Status

AutoVideo v1 implements comprehensive security measures to protect the system and user data.

### **Authentication & Access Control** ✅

- **No Public Access**: All endpoints require proper authentication
- **Authorized Users Only**: Limited to specific users and service accounts
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Uses Google Cloud identity tokens
- **Workload Identity Federation**: No service account keys stored in code

### **Network Security** ✅

- **VPC Configuration**: Optimized egress settings for secure API access
- **Private Container Registry**: Images stored in private Google Container Registry
- **Encrypted Communications**: All API calls use HTTPS/TLS
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking and monitoring

### **API Security** ✅

- **API Key Validation**: Fail-fast validation at startup
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Timeout Management**: Prevents resource exhaustion
- **Health Monitoring**: Dedicated endpoints for security diagnostics

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to the repository owner
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for investigation and resolution

### **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Investigation**: 1-7 days depending on complexity  
- **Resolution**: As soon as possible, with security patches prioritized
- **Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and verified

## Security Best Practices

### **For Developers**

- Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Follow the principle of least privilege for permissions
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities

### **For Deployment**

- Use Workload Identity Federation instead of service account keys
- Implement proper IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Enable audit logging and monitoring
- Use private container registries
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials

### **For Operations**

- Monitor system health and API connectivity
- Review access logs regularly
- Implement alerting for security events
- Keep all components updated with latest security patches
- Conduct regular security reviews
